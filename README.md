###Introduction
This is my personal website's repository.  Feel free to use my code as a baseline for your own website if you are interested.  This site is my playground for Angular and Node to take to my more serious projects.  Check it out!

###Building
Building the project is really easy.  Just clone the repository and run the below commands.  There are no special programs that you need to install other than **npm** and **bower**.

```bash
npm install
bower install
npm run
```

**NOTE:** You need to create an *account.json* file in your config folder to configure the email to send to your account instead of mine!  Inside of this file you should have the following format.

```json
{
    "service": "gmail",
    "username": "YOUR_USER",
    "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD"
}
```
